 ## Different game modes
 
 ### Draw 3
 
 Other way of playing the game is using the same cars so that the player in turn draws 3 cards and then the players try to complete the indicated play. If success then the player discards two of those and gives one of the cards to the next player. Next player draws 3 cards and adds the one given card to the play and then the players try to complete the play of 4 cards. In next turn it is then possible to have a play of 5 of keep it at 4 by either drawing more cards or passing on more cards. Those are simple tweaks and choices to the rules to decide before starting the game.
